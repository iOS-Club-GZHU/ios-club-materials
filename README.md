# Swift Programming Language

## Welcome to Swift

Swift is a high-performance system programming language.  It has a clean
and modern syntax, offers seamless access to existing C and Objective-C code
and frameworks, and is memory-safe by default.

Although inspired by Objective-C and many other languages, Swift is not itself a
C-derived language. As a complete and independent language, Swift packages core
features like flow control, data structures, and functions, with high-level
constructs like objects, protocols, closures, and generics. Swift embraces
modules, eliminating the need for headers and the code duplication they entail.

To learn more about the programming language, visit [swift.org](https://swift.org/documentation/).

## Getting Started

If you are interested in:
- Contributing fixes and features to the compiler: See our
  [How to Submit Your First Pull Request guide](/docs/HowToGuides/FirstPullRequest.md).
- Building the compiler as a one-off: See our [Getting Started guide][].
- Building a toolchain as a one-off: Follow the [Getting Started guide][]
  up until the "Building the project" section. After that, follow the
  instructions in the [Swift Toolchains](#swift-toolchains) section below.

We also have an [FAQ](/docs/HowToGuides/FAQ.md) that answers common questions.
